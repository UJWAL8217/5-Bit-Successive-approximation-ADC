# 5-Bit-Successive-approximation-ADC
Successive approximation register ADC is a analog to digital converter which is very useful in embedded systemsfor interfacing analog sensors.
This project involved design of 5 bit dac(R-2R DAC), 5 bit successive approximation register and d flipflop. The output of dac is compared with sampled analog input voltage, based on the comparator output voltage, Successive approximation register bit is set or reset.
